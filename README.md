# CPP Pool (42 School Project)

CPP Pool is a project for those who wants to learn C++ form the very beginning. 
It consists of 9 daily projects (each of them may include 4-20 small tasks) and 2 global projects - rushes (they offer you to create a game and a program respectively).

All pdf-files with tasks are in the appropriate folders (check files named **dxx.en.pdf** where *xx* is the number of day starting with 00).

**The most markable projects from the pool:**
* [Calculator](/day02/ex04/), that handles parentheses.
* ["cat" program analog](/day01/ex10/)
* ["ft_retro" game](/rush00/) a shell game made using <ncurses> library (in collaboration with @etugoluk)

### How to run
You will find a **Makefile** inside every task folder. Just run it and after compiling run the appropriate binary file.

*Note: the solution for rush01 is not included*

### Enjoy!
